## The concept

"Data Baby" is a humorous and visually rich book which attempts to answer - using data - the "I wonder" questions that all parents have.  "Data Baby" won't address the most recent medical protocol regarding infant vaccinations, vitamin supplementation during pregancy, or other serious and important topics to which a plethora of books are already devoted.  Rather, it will take readers on an informative (but somewhat absurd) data-driven journey all the way from foreplay to pre-k, stopping along the way to ponder questions like:   

- How many pregnancies are the result of infidelity?  
- Does a child's birth month affect their performance in school and sports?   
- How much sleep do parents get in the first year after birth?  
- How many diapers does a baby go through (and what's the carbon footprint on all those diapers)?  
- What impact did events like Ronald Reagan's election, the release of "Titanic" and 9/11 have on baby names?  
- Are more babies born on full moons?    

Along the way, we'll take a few unexpected detours (like why elite athletes are more likely to have female offspring, how getting a promotion affects your fertility, and where breastfeeding is most and least common). There won't be an overriding message or story, but a series of sub-stories, each accompanied by an assortment of anecdotes, charts and maps.    

"Data Baby" will rely on raw census data, academic studies, and "soft" data sources (e.g., web-scraped information from twitter and google).  It will be written in an informal voice, can be enjoyed non-sequentially (though the format will be sequential) and will appeal to parents (and those expecting), especially readers with a penchant for numbers.

## The market

An Amazon search for "data baby" yields mostly electronic devices. Searching for "baby data" yields lots of hits related to "baby", but very few related to "data".
