## The concept

"Data Baby" is a humorous and visually rich book which attempts to answer, using data, the "I wonder" questions that we all have as parents.  "Data Baby" won't address the most recent medical protocol regarding infant vaccinations, vitamin supplementation during pregancy, or other serious and important topics to which a plethora of books are already devoted.  Rather, it will take readers on a data-driven journey all the way from foreplay to pre-k, stopping along the way to ponder questions like:  
- How many pregnancies are the result of infidelity?  
- Does a child's birthday affects their performance in school and sports?   
- How much sleep do parents get in the first year after birth?  
- How many diapers does a baby go through (and what's the carbon footprint on all those diapers)?

Along the way, we'll take a few unexpected detours (like how elite athletes are much more likely to have female offspring
